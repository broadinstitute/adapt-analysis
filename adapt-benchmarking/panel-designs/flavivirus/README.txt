This contains designs for a set of flavivirus species with
specificity among them (see design.sh).

flavivirus.all-human.tsv contains the of all flavivirus (genus) species
known to infect human.

In flavivirus.clade.tsv, I took a clade with 20 species (closely-related),
and filtered flavivirus.all-human.tsv for these: it contained 17 of them.
The clade is from https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/positive-sense-rna-viruses/w/flaviviridae
