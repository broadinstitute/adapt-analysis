This is a set of all vertebrate-infecting viruses designed in my
`adapt-designs-continuous` repo. They were designed as part of
different experiments: with and without specificity, and maximizing
acitivty and minimizing number of guides. The results are copied from
there to here (`summary.one-segment-per-taxid.tsv`).
