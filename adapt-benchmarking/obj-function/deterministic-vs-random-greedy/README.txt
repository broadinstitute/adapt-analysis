This compares results for two algorithms for submodular maximization: 'greedy'
(canonical, deterministic greedy algorithm) vs. 'random-greedy' (randomized
greedy algorithm in Buchbinder 2014).  The former may do well in practice but
assumptions do not hold because the function is non-monotone, whereas the
latter works with non-monotone functions so it provides worst-case guarantees.
