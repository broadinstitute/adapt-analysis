All accession lists were pulled from NCBI's influenza virus resource.
They were filtered for full-length only, collection date 2017-01-01
onward, and human host (any host for non-H1/H3 and non-N1/N2 accessions).

For pan-IAV, I use PB1 (segment 2); papers state this is the most
conserved segment. For IBV, I also use PB1 (segment 1) to make it
easier to account for specificity with IAV, and also because
https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1094 states it maintains in separate
IBV lineages.
