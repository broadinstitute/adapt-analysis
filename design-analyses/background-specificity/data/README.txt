The index representing background consists of:
  - Human transcripts (GENCODE v38; 237,012 transcript sequences)
  - NCBI reference sequences for genomes of 11 common bacterial pathogens (list from Nicole; listed in common-bacterial-pathogens.tsv)
The index also contains SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RefSeq genomes as a positive control for the alignments.
