This generalizes the scripts one directory up, to plot cumulative number
of sequences (*not* necessarily genomes) given a list of accessions.
This is not necessarily the number of genomes because each chromosome or
segment (i.e., any sequence with its own accession) will be counted as one.

For the Plasmodium falciparum example, I searched GenBank for 'txid5833[Organism:exp]' and used only the 'genome DNA/RNA' molecule type (not mRNA).
