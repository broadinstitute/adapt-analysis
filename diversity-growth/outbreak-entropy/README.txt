This analysis is meant to show the increase in entropy (nucleotide) along the genome
of k-mers within a sliding window. If we were to look within a window and choose
a k-mer (say, 28-mer) to use as a guide for detection, it's to show that the
diversity of them is growing throughout the genome over time -- and thus we have
to be careful in how we select it.

SARS-CoV-2 is a good example because there are so many genomes over the course
of the outbreak, so we can show this as a detailed time-resolution.
